# JDBC plugin for Elasticsearch
![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/jprante/elasticsearch-river-jdbc.png)

The Java Database Connection (JDBC) plugin allows to fetch data from JDBC sources for
indexing into [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org).

It is implemented as an [Elasticsearch plugin](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/plugins.html).

Creating a JDBC river is easy. Install the plugin. Download a JDBC driver jar from your vendor's site
(for example MySQL) and put the jar into the folder of the plugin `$ES_HOME/plugins/river-jdbc`.
Then issue this simple command::

    curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
        "type" : "jdbc",
        "jdbc" : {
            "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
            "user" : "",
            "password" : "",
            "sql" : "select * from orders"
        }
    }'

## Two flavors: river or feeder

The plugin can operate as a river in "pull mode" or as a feeder in "push mode".
In feeder mode, the plugin runs in a separate JVM and can connect to a remote Elasticsearch cluster.

![Architecture](https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/raw/master/src/site/resources/jdbc-river-feeder-architecture.png)

The relational data is internally transformed into structured JSON objects for the schema-less
indexing model of Elasticsearch documents.

![Simple data stream](https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/raw/master/src/site/resources/simple-tabular-json-data.png)

Both ends are scalable. The plugin can fetch data from different RDBMS source in parallel, and multithreaded
bulk mode ensures high throughput when indexing to Elasticsearch.

## Prerequisites

- a JDBC driver jar for your database. You should download a driver from the vendor site. Put the jar into JDBC plugin folder.

## Installation

    ./bin/plugin --install jdbc --url http://xbib.org/repository/org/xbib/elasticsearch/plugin/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/1.3.0.4/elasticsearch-river-jdbc-1.3.0.4-plugin.zip

Do not forget to restart the node after installing.

If you have installed Elasticsearch with other automation tools, like for example Homebrew,
you will need to locate your `ES_HOME` directory.  The easiest way to do this is by navigating to

    localhost:9200/_cluster/nodes?settings=true&pretty=true

Change into this directory to invoke the `./bin/plugin` command line tool.

# Documentation

## River or feeder?

The plugin comes in two flavors, river or feeder. Here are the differences.
Depending on your requirements, it is up to you to make a reasonable choice.

Note, the JDBC river code wraps the feeder code, there is no reinvention of anything.
Main difference is the different handling by starting/stopping the process by
a separate JVM in the feeder flavor.

| River                            | Feeder                             |
| ---------------------------------| -----------------------------------|
| standard method of Elasticsearch to connect to external sources and pull data | method to connect to external sources for pushing data into Elasticsearch |
| multiple river instances, many river types | no feeder types, feeder instances are separate JVMs |
| based on an internal index `_river` to keep state | based on a feeder document in the Elasticsearch index for maintaining state |
| does not scale, single local node only | scalable, not limited to single node, can connect to local or remote clusters |
| automatic failover and restart after cluster recovery | no failover, no restart |
| hard to supervise single or multi runs and interruptions | command line control of feeds, error exit code 1, crontab control |
| no standard method of  viewing river activity from within Elasticsearch | feed activity can be monitored by examining separate JVM |
| about to be deprecated by Elasticsearch core team | Feeder API provided by xbib, using advanced features supported by xbib libraries only. Part of upcoming "gatherer" API to support coordinated data harvesting by multiple ES nodes |

## How to start the JDBC river

Prerequisites:

A running MySQL database `test`, a table `orders`, and a user without name and password (default user)

A terminal / console with commands `curl` and `unzip` and Internet access (of course)

1. Download elasticsearch (latest version that is compatible with JDBC plugin)

	`curl -OL https://github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.1.0.0.zip`

2. Unpack zip file into you favorite elasticsearch directory, we call it $ES_HOME

	`cd $ES_HOME`

	`unzip path/to/elasticsearch-1.1.0.0.zip`

3. Install JDBC plugin

	`./bin/plugin --install jdbc --url http://xbib.org/repository/org/xbib/elasticsearch/plugin/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/1.1.0.2/elasticsearch-river-jdbc-1.1.0.2-plugin.zip`

4. Download MySQL JDBC driver

	`curl -o mysql-connector-java-5.1.28.zip -L 'http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.28.zip/from/http://cdn.mysql.com/'`

5. Add MySQL JDBC driver jar to JDBC river plugin directory and set access permission for .jar file (at least chmod 644)

	`cp mysql-connector-java-5.1.28-bin.jar $ES_HOME/plugins/jdbc/`
	`chmod 644 $ES_HOME/plugins/jdbc/`

6. Start elasticsearch from terminal window

	`./bin/elasticsearch`

7. Now you should notice from the log lines that a jdbc plugin has been installed (together with a support plugin)

8. Start another terminal, and create a JDBC river instance with name `my_jdbc_river`

    ```
	curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
	    "type" : "jdbc",
	    "jdbc" : {
	        "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
	        "user" : "",
	        "password" : "",
	        "sql" : "select * from orders"
	    }
	}'
	```

9. The river runs immediately. It will run exactly once. Watch the log on the elasticsearch terminal
   for the river activity. When the river fetched the data, you can query your elasticsearch node
   for the data you just indexed with the following command

	`curl 'localhost:9200/jdbc/_search?pretty&q=*'`

10. Enjoy the result!

11. If you want to stop the `my_jdbc_river` river fetching data from the `orders` table after the
    quick demonstration, use this command

	`curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river'`

Now, if you want more fine-tuning, add a schedule for fetching data regularly,
you can change the index name, add more SQL statements, tune bulk indexing,
change the mapping, change the river creation settings.

## JDBC plugin parameters

Important note: all plugin-related parameters are subsumed in the `jdbc` section of a river delaration.
For example, if you declare an index for the JDBC plugin, this parameter must be placed within
the `jdbc` section, not outside of it!

    ```
	curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
	    "type" : "jdbc",
	    "jdbc" : {
	         <all parameters go here>
	    }
	}'
	```
	
Example:
	
    ```
	curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
	    "type" : "jdbc",
	    "jdbc" : {
            "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
            "user" : "",
            "password" : "",
            "sql" : "select * from orders",
            "index" : "myindex",
            "type" : "mytype",
            ...	         
	    }
	}'
	```

`strategy` -the strategy of the JDBC plugin, currently implemented: "simple", "column"

`url` - the JDBC driver URL

`user` - the JDBC database user

`password` - the JDBC database password

`sql`  - SQL statement(s), either a string or a list. If a statement ends with .sql, the statement is looked up in the file system. Example for a list of SQL statements:

	"sql" : [
	    {
	        "statement" : "select ... from ... where a = ?, b = ?, c = ?",
	        "parameter" : [ "value for a", "value for b", "value for c" ]
	    },
	    {
	        "statement" : ...
	    }
	]

`sql.statement` - the SQL statement

`sql.callable` - boolean flag, if true, the SQL statement is interpreted as a JDBC CallableStatement for stored procedures (default: false).

`sql.parameter` - bind parameters for the SQL statement (in order). Some special values can be used with the following meanings:

  * `$now` - the current timestamp
  * `$job` - job ID from context
  * `$count` - last number of rows merged
  * `$river.name` - the river name
  * `$last.sql.start` - a timestamp value for the time when the last SQL statement started
  * `$last.sql.end` - a timestamp value for the time when the last SQL statement ended
  * `$last.sql.sequence.start` - a timestamp value for the time when the last SQL sequence started
  * `$last.sql.sequence.end` - a timestamp value for the time when the last SQL sequence ended
  * `$river.state.started` - the timestamp of river start (from river state)
  * `$river.state.timestamp` - last timestamp of river activity (from river state)
  * `$river.state.counter` - counter from river state, counts the numbers of runs

`locale` - the default locale (used for parsing numerical values, floating point character. Recommended values is "en_US")

`timezone` - the timezone for JDBC setTimestamp() calls when binding parameters with timestamp values

`rounding` -  rounding mode for parsing numeric values. Possible values  "ceiling", "down", "floor", "halfdown", "halfeven", "halfup", "unnecessary", "up"

`scale` -  the precision of parsing numeric values

`ignore_null_values` - if NULL values should be ignored when constructing JSON documents. Default is `false`

`autocommit` -  `true` if each statement should be automatically executed. Default is `false`

`fetchsize` - the fetchsize for large result sets, most drivers use this to control the amount of rows in the buffer while iterating through the result set

`max_rows` - limit the number of rows fetches by a statement, the rest of the rows is ignored

`max_retries` - the number of retries to (re)connect to a database

`max_retries_wait` - (timev alue) the time that should be waited between retries. Default is "30s"

`index` - the Elasticsearch index used for indexing

`type` - the Elasticsearch type of the index used for indexing

`index_settings` - optional settings for the Elasticsearch index

`type_mapping` - optional mapping for the Elasticsearch index type

`maxbulkactions` - the length of each bulk index request submitted

`maxconcurrrentbulkactions` - the maximum number of concurrent bulk requests

`schedule` - a single or a list of cron expressions for scheduled execution. Syntax is equivalent to the
Quartz cron expression format (see below).

`cronpoolsize` - the thread pool size of the cron job executions for `schedule` parameter. If set to `1`, all jobs will be executed serially. Default is `4`.

## Default parameter settings

	{
	    "jdbc" :{
	        "strategy" : "simple",
	        "url" : null,
	        "user" : null,

	        "maxbulkactions" : 1000,
	        "maxconcurrentbulkactions" : 4 * available CPU cores,
	    }
	}

## Time scheduled execution of JDBC river

Setting a cron expression in the paramter `schedule` enables repeated (or time scheduled) runs of JDBC river.

You can also define a list of cron expressions (in a JSON array) to schedule for many
different time schedules.

Example of a `schedule` paramter:

        "schedule" : "0 0-59 0-23 ? * *"

This executes JDBC river every minute, every hour, all the days in the week/month/year.

The following documentation about the syntax of the cron expression is copied from the Quartz 
scheduler javadoc page.

Cron expressions provide the ability to specify complex time combinations such as
"At 8:00am every Monday through Friday" or "At 1:30am every last Friday of the month".

Cron expressions are comprised of 6 required fields and one optional field separated by
white space. The fields respectively are described as follows:

| Field Name      | Allowed Values      | Allowed Special Characters  |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------|
| Seconds         | 0-59                | , - * / |
| Minutes         | 0-59                | , - * / |
| Hours           | 0-23                | , - * / |
| Day-of-month    | 1-31                | , - * ? / L W |
| Month           | 1-12 or JAN-DEC     | , - * / |
| Day-of-Week     | 1-7 or SUN-SAT      | , - * ? / L # |
| Year (Optional) | empty, 1970-2199    | , - * / |

The '*' character is used to specify all values. For example, "*" in the minute field means "every minute".

The '?' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
It is used to specify 'no specific value'.
This is useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other.

The '-' character is used to specify ranges For example "10-12" in the hour field means
"the hours 10, 11 and 12".

The ',' character is used to specify additional values. For example "MON,WED,FRI" in the
day-of-week field means "the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday".

The '/' character is used to specify increments. For example "0/15" in the seconds field means
"the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45". And "5/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50".
Specifying '*' before the '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is the value to start with.
Essentially, for each field in the expression, there is a set of numbers that can be turned on or off.
For seconds and minutes, the numbers range from 0 to 59.
For hours 0 to 23, for days of the month 0 to 31, and for months 1 to 12.
The "/" character simply helps you turn on every "nth" value in the given set.
Thus "7/6" in the month field only turns on month "7", it does NOT mean every 6th month,
please note that subtlety.

The 'L' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
This character is short-hand for "last", but it has different meaning in each of the two fields.
For example, the value "L" in the day-of-month field means "the last day of the month" - day
31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself,
it simply means "7" or "SAT". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value,
it means "the last xxx day of the month" - for example "6L" means "the last friday of the month".
You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as "L-3" which would mean
the third-to-last day of the calendar month. When using the 'L' option, it is important not
to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing/unexpected results.

The 'W' character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This character is used to specify
the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify "15W"
as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month".
So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th.
If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th.
If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th.
However if you specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday,
the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days.
The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day,
not a range or list of days.

The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined for the day-of-month expression to yield 'LW',
which translates to "last weekday of the month".

The '#' character is allowed for the day-of-week field. This character is used to specify
"the nth" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of "6#3" in the day-of-week field means
the third Friday of the month (day 6 = Friday and "#3" = the 3rd one in the month).
Other examples: "2#1" = the first Monday of the month and "4#5" = the fifth Wednesday of the month.
Note that if you specify "#5" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month,
then no firing will occur that month. If the '#' character is used, there can only be
one expression in the day-of-week field ("3#1,6#3" is not valid, since there are two expressions).

The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive.

Note: Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is not complete
(you'll need to use the '?' character in one of these fields).
Overflowing ranges is supported - that is, having a larger number on the left hand side than the right.
You might do 22-2 to catch 10 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in the morning, or you might have NOV-FEB.
It is very important to note that overuse of overflowing ranges creates ranges that don't make sense
and no effort has been made to determine which interpretation CronExpression chooses.
An example would be "0 0 14-6 ? * FRI-MON".


## Obsolete parameters

In older versions of JDBC river, the following parameters were available. They are no longer supported.

`driver` - Class name of JDBC river. Since JDBC plugin requires JDBC Version 4 (or higher), which is
part of Java 6, this parameter is not used any more.

`poll` - interval for waiting between river invocations. Replaced by `schedule`

`bulk_size` - renamed to `maxbulkactions`

`max_bulk_requests` - renamed to `maxconcurrrentbulkactions`

`bulk_flush_interval` - no longer supported, replaced by internal flush invocations

## How to start a JDBC feeder

In the `bin/feeder` directory, you find some feeder examples.

A feed can be started from the `$ES_HOME/plugins/jdbc` folder. If not already present, you should
create a `bin` folder so it is easy to maintain feeder script side by side with the river.

The feeder script must include the Elasticsearch core libraries into the classpath. Note the `-cp`
parameter.

Here is an example of a feeder bash script in `$ES_HOME/plugins/jdbc/bin/feeder/oracle.create.sh`

    #!/bin/sh

    java="/usr/bin/java"
    #java="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java"
    #java="/usr/java/jdk1.8.0/bin/java"

    echo '
    {
        "concurrency" : 1,
        "elasticsearch" : "es://localhost:9300?es.cluster.name=elasticsearch",
        "client" : "bulk",
        "jdbc" : {
            "url" : "jdbc:oracle:thin:@//host:1521/sid",
            "user" : "user",
            "password" : "password",
            "sql" : "select or_id as \"_id\", or_tan as \"tan\" from orders",
            "index" : "myoracle",
            "type" : "myoracle",
            "index_settings" : {
                "index" : {
                    "number_of_shards" : 1,
                    "number_of_replica" : 0
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ' | ${java} \
        -cp $(pwd):$(pwd)/\*:$(pwd)/../../lib/\* \
        org.xbib.elasticsearch.plugin.feeder.Runner \
        org.xbib.elasticsearch.plugin.feeder.jdbc.JDBCFeeder

The `jdbc` parameter structure is exactly the same as in a river.

The feeder is invoked by `org.xbib.elasticsearch.plugin.feeder.Runner org.xbib.elasticsearch.plugin.feeder.jdbc.JDBCFeeder`
and understands some more parameters. In this example, the default parameters are shown.

`elasticsearch` - an URI pointing to a host of an Elasticsearch cluster. In `es.cluster.name` you can configure the
cluster name you want to connect to.

`client` - the value `bulk` enables a transport client with the vanilla BulkProcessor, `ingest` enables a transport client with a customized IngestProcessor (advanced feature, only available with the xbib elasticsearch-support plugin)

`concurrency` - how many `jdbc` jobs should be executed in parallel

In the example, you can also see that you can change your favorite `java` executable when
executing a feed.

## Structured objects

One of the advantage of SQL queries is the join operation. From many tables, new tuples can be formed.

	curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
	    "type" : "jdbc",
	    "jdbc" : {
	        "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
	        "user" : "",
	        "password" : "",
	        "sql" : "select \"relations\" as \"_index\", orders.customer as \"_id\", orders.customer as \"contact.customer\", employees.name as \"contact.employee\" from orders left join employees on employees.department = orders.department"
	    }
	}'

For example, these rows from SQL

	mysql> select "relations" as "_index", orders.customer as "_id", orders.customer as "contact.customer", employees.name as "contact.employee"  from orders left join employees on employees.department = orders.department;
	+-----------+-------+------------------+------------------+
	| _index    | _id   | contact.customer | contact.employee |
	+-----------+-------+------------------+------------------+
	| relations | Big   | Big              | Smith            |
	| relations | Large | Large            | Müller           |
	| relations | Large | Large            | Meier            |
	| relations | Large | Large            | Schulze          |
	| relations | Huge  | Huge             | Müller           |
	| relations | Huge  | Huge             | Meier            |
	| relations | Huge  | Huge             | Schulze          |
	| relations | Good  | Good             | Müller           |
	| relations | Good  | Good             | Meier            |
	| relations | Good  | Good             | Schulze          |
	| relations | Bad   | Bad              | Jones            |
	+-----------+-------+------------------+------------------+
	11 rows in set (0.00 sec)

will generate fewer JSON objects for the index `relations`.

	index=relations id=Big {"contact":{"employee":"Smith","customer":"Big"}}
	index=relations id=Large {"contact":{"employee":["Müller","Meier","Schulze"],"customer":"Large"}}
	index=relations id=Huge {"contact":{"employee":["Müller","Meier","Schulze"],"customer":"Huge"}}
	index=relations id=Good {"contact":{"employee":["Müller","Meier","Schulze"],"customer":"Good"}}
	index=relations id=Bad {"contact":{"employee":"Jones","customer":"Bad"}}

Note how the `employee` column is collapsed into a JSON array. The repeated occurence of the `_id` column
controls how values are folded into arrays for making use of the Elasticsearch JSON data model.


## Column names for JSON document construction

In SQL, each column may be labeled. This label is used by the JDBC plugin for JSON document
construction. The dot is the path separator for the document strcuture.

For example, this JDBC river

	curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
	    "type" : "jdbc",
	    "jdbc" : {
	        "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
	        "user" : "",
	        "password" : "",
	        "sql" : "select products.name as \"product.name\", orders.customer as \"product.customer.name\", orders.quantity * products.price as \"product.customer.bill\" from products, orders where products.name = orders.product"
	    }
	}'

the labeled columns are `product.name`, `product.customer.name`, and `product.customer.bill`.

A data example:

	mysql> select products.name as "product.name", orders.customer as "product.customer", orders.quantity * products.price as "product.customer.bill" from products, orders where products.name = orders.product ;
	+--------------+------------------+-----------------------+
	| product.name | product.customer | product.customer.bill |
	+--------------+------------------+-----------------------+
	| Apples       | Big              |                     1 |
	| Bananas      | Large            |                     2 |
	| Oranges      | Huge             |                     6 |
	| Apples       | Good             |                     2 |
	| Oranges      | Bad              |                     9 |
	+--------------+------------------+-----------------------+
	5 rows in set, 5 warnings (0.00 sec)

The structured objects constructed from these columns are

	id=0 {"product":{"name":"Apples","customer":{"bill":1.0,"name":"Big"}}}
	id=1 {"product":{"name":"Bananas","customer":{"bill":2.0,"name":"Large"}}}
	id=2 {"product":{"name":"Oranges","customer":{"bill":6.0,"name":"Huge"}}}
	id=3 {"product":{"name":"Apples","customer":{"bill":2.0,"name":"Good"}}}
	id=4 {"product":{"name":"Oranges","customer":{"bill":9.0,"name":"Bad"}}}

There are column labels with an underscore as prefix that are mapped to special Elasticsearch document parameters for indexing:

	_index     the index this object should be indexed into
	_type      the type this object should be indexed into
	_id        the id of this object
	_version   the version of this object
	_parent    the parent,
	_ttl       the time-to-live of this object
	_routing   the routing of this object

## Bracket notation for JSON array construction

When construction JSON documents, it is often the case you want to group SQL columns into a JSON object and
line them up into JSON arrays. For allowing this, a bracket notation is used to identify children
elements that repeat in each child.

Note, because of limitations in identifying SQL column groups, nested document structures may lead to
repititions of the same group. Fortunately, this is harmless to Elasticsearch queries.

Example:

| _id  | blog.name | blog.published      | blog.association[id] | blog.association[name] | blog.attachment[id]   | blog.attachment[name]    |
| ---- | ----------| --------------------| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 4679 | Joe       | 2014-01-06 00:00:00 | 3917                 | John                   | 9450                  | /web/q/g/h/57436356.jpg  |
| 4679 | Joe       | 2014-01-06 00:00:00 | 3917                 | John                   | 9965                  | /web/i/s/q/GS3193626.jpg |
| 4679 | Joe       | 2014-01-06 00:00:00 | 3917                 | John                   | 9451                  | /web/i/s/q/GS3193626.jpg |

Result:

    {
        "blog" : {
            "attachment": [
                {
                    "name" : "/web/q/g/h/57436356.jpg",
                    "id" : "9450"
                },
                {
                    "name" : "/web/i/s/q/GS3193626.jpg",
                    "id" : "9965"
                },
                {
                    "name" : "/web/i/s/q/GS3193626.jpg",
                    "id" : "9451"
                }
            ],
            "name" : "Joe",
            "association" : [
                {
                    "name" : "John",
                    "id" : "3917"
                },
                {
                    "name" : "John",
                    "id" : "3917"
                },
                {
                    "name" : "John",
                    "id" : "3917"
                }
             ],
             "published":"2014-01-06 00:00:00"
         }
    }

## How to fetch a table?

For fetching a table, a simple "select *" (star) query can be used.
Star queries are the simplest variant of selecting data from a database.
They dump tables into Elasticsearch row-by-row. If no `_id` column name is given, IDs will be automatically generated.

For example, this river

	curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
	    "type" : "jdbc",
	    "jdbc" : {
	        "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
	        "user" : "",
	        "password" : "",
	        "sql" : "select * from orders"
	    }
	}'

and this table

	mysql> select * from orders;
	+----------+-----------------+---------+----------+---------------------+
	| customer | department      | product | quantity | created             |
	+----------+-----------------+---------+----------+---------------------+
	| Big      | American Fruits | Apples  |        1 | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |
	| Large    | German Fruits   | Bananas |        1 | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |
	| Huge     | German Fruits   | Oranges |        2 | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |
	| Good     | German Fruits   | Apples  |        2 | 2012-06-01 00:00:00 |
	| Bad      | English Fruits  | Oranges |        3 | 2012-06-01 00:00:00 |
	+----------+-----------------+---------+----------+---------------------+
	5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

will result into the following JSON documents

	id=<random> {"product":"Apples","created":null,"department":"American Fruits","quantity":1,"customer":"Big"}
	id=<random> {"product":"Bananas","created":null,"department":"German Fruits","quantity":1,"customer":"Large"}
	id=<random> {"product":"Oranges","created":null,"department":"German Fruits","quantity":2,"customer":"Huge"}
	id=<random> {"product":"Apples","created":1338501600000,"department":"German Fruits","quantity":2,"customer":"Good"}
	id=<random> {"product":"Oranges","created":1338501600000,"department":"English Fruits","quantity":3,"customer":"Bad"}

# Stored procedures or callable statements

Stored procedures can also be used for fetchng data, like this example fo MySQL illustrates. 
See also [Using Stored Procedures](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/storedprocedures.html)
from where the example is taken.

    create procedure GET_SUPPLIER_OF_COFFEE(
        IN coffeeName varchar(32), 
        OUT supplierName varchar(40)) 
        begin 
            select SUPPLIERS.SUP_NAME into supplierName 
            from SUPPLIERS, COFFEES 
            where SUPPLIERS.SUP_ID = COFFEES.SUP_ID 
            and coffeeName = COFFEES.COF_NAME; 
            select supplierName; 
        end

Now it is possible to call the procedure from the JDBC plugin and index the result in Elasticsearch.

    {
        "jdbc" : {
            "url" : "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test",
            "user" : "",
            "password" : "",
            "sql" : [
                {
                    "callable" : true,
                    "statement" : "{call GET_SUPPLIER_OF_COFFEE(?,?)}",
                    "parameter" : [
                         "Colombian"
                    ],
                    "register" : {
                         "mySupplierName" : { "pos" : 2, "type" : "varchar" }
                    }
                }
            ],
            "index" : "my_jdbc_river_index",
            "type" : "my_jdbc_river_type"
        }
    }

Note, the `parameter` lists the input parameters in the order they should be applied, like in an
ordinary statement. The `register` declares a list of output parameters in the particular order
the `pos` number indicates. It is required to declare the JDBC type in the `type` attribute.
`mySupplierName`, the key of the output parameter, is used as the Elasticsearch field name specification,
like the column name specification in an ordinary SQL statement, because column names are not available
in callable statement result sets.

If there is more than one result sets returned by a callable statement,
the JDBC plugin enters a loop and iterates through all result sets.

# Monitoring the JDBC river state

While a river/feed is running, you can monitor the activity by using the `_state` command.

When running very large data fetches, it might be of interest to find out if the fetch is complete or still running.

The `_state` command can show the state of a specific river or of all rivers, when an asterisk `*` is used as the river name.

In the result, you can evaluate the field `active`. If set to `true`, the river is actively fetching data from the database.

In the field `timestamp`, the latest state modification of the river is recorded.

Example:

    curl 'localhost:9200/_river/jdbc/*/_state?pretty'
    {
      "state" : [ {
        "name" : "my_oracle_river",
        "type" : "jdbc",
        "enabled" : true,
        "started" : "2014-05-10T20:29:04.260Z",
        "timestamp" : "2014-05-10T20:52:15.866Z",
        "counter" : 3,
        "active" : true,
        "custom" : {
          "rivername" : "feeder",
          "settings" : {
            "index" : "myoracle",
            "sql" : [ "select or_id as \"_id\", or_tan as \"tan\" from orders" ],
            "maxbulkactions" : 10,
            "type" : "myoracle",
            "password" : "...",
            "user" : "...",
            "url" : "jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/sid"
          },
          "locale" : "de_",
          "job" : null,
          "sql" : [ "statement=select or_id as \"_id\", or_tan as \"tan\" from orders parameter=[] callable=false" ],
          "autocommit" : false,
          "fetchsize" : 10,
          "maxrows" : 0,
          "retries" : 3,
          "maxretrywait" : "30s",
          "resultsetconcurrency" : "CONCUR_UPDATABLE",
          "resultsettype" : "TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY",
          "rounding" : 0,
          "scale" : 2
        }
      } ]
    }


# Advanced topics

## RiverSource, RiverMouth, RiverFlow

The JDBC river consists of three conceptual interfaces than can be implemented separately.

When you use the ``strategy`` parameter, the JDBC river tries to load additional classes before
falling back to the ``simple`` strategy.

You can implement your own strategy by adding your implementation jars to the plugin folder and
exporting the implementing classes in the ``META-INF/services`` directory. The ``RiverService`` looks up implementations for your favorite ``strategy`` before the JDBC river initializes.

So, it is easy to reuse or replace existing code, or adapt your own JDBC retrieval strategy
to the core JDBC river.

### RiverSource

The river source models the data producing side. Beside defining the JDBC connect parameters, it manages a dual-channel connection to the data producer for reading and for writing.
The reading channel is used for fetching data, while the writing channel can update the source.

The RiverSource API can be inspected at http://jprante.github.io/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/apidocs/org/xbib/elasticsearch/river/jdbc/RiverSource.html

### RiverMouth

The ``RiverMouth`` is the abstraction of the destination where all the data is flowing from the river source. It controls the resource usage of the bulk indexing method of Elasticsearch. Throttling is possible by limiting the number of bulk actions per request or by the maximum number of concurrent request.

The RiverMouth API can be inspected at http://jprante.github.io/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/apidocs/org/xbib/elasticsearch/river/jdbc/RiverSource.html

### RiverFlow

The ``RiverFlow`` is the abstraction to the thread which performs data fetching from the river source and transports it to the river mouth. A 'move' is considered a single step in the river live cycle. A river flow can be aborted.

The RiverFlow API can be inspected at http://jprante.github.io/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/apidocs/org/xbib/elasticsearch/river/jdbc/RiverFlow.html

## Strategies

The JDBC plugin can be configured for different methods of data transport.
Such methods of data transports are called a 'strategy'.

By default, the JDBC plugin implements a ``simple`` strategy.

## Simple strategy

This strategy contains the following steps of processing:

1. fetch data from the JDBC connection
2. build structured objects and move them to Elasticsearch for indexing or deleting

In the ``sql`` parameter of the river, a series of SQL statements can be defined which are executed at each river cycle to fetch the data.

## Your custom strategy

If you want to extend the JDBC plugin, for example by your custom password authentication, you could
extend the SimpleRiverSource. Then, declare your strategy classes in `META-INF/services`. Add your
jar to the classpath and add the `strategy` parameter to the river/feeder specifications.


## Support plugin

The JDBC plugin comes bundled with the xbib Elasticsearch support plugin. This plugin contains
various additions to the Elasticsearch core for reuse by other (xbib) plugins too.

The JDBC zip contains the support jar beside the JDBC plugin jar, so it is easy to identify the
support plugin that is bundled with the JDBC plugin.

Currently, Elasticseach does not use classpath separation between plugins. So unfortunately,
you must take care  for yourself that you have only one version of each jar in your classpath.
If you find different versions of the support plugin jar in the folders of your Elasticsearch plugins,
remove the jars you do not need.

Note: if you update the JDBC plugin, old versions of the support plugin are NOT removed automatically.

# Some real-world examples

## Step by step recipe for setting up the JDBC river with PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL

   Example: PostgreSQL .dmg (Version 9.1.5) for Mac OS X from http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload

   Filename: postgresql-9.1.5-1-osx.dmg

2. Install Elasticsearch

   Follow instructions on http://elasticsearch.org

3. Install JDBC plugin

   Check for the JDBC version under http://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-river/jdbc

	    cd $ES_HOME
	    ./bin/plugin -install river-jdbc -url http://xbib.org/repository/org/xbib/elasticsearch/plugin/elasticsearch-river-jdbc/1.2.0.1/elasticsearch-river-jdbc-1.2.0.1-plugin.zip

4. Download PostgreSQL JDBC driver

   Check http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html

   Current version is JDBC4 Postgresql Driver, Version 9.1-902

   Filname postgresql-9.1-902.jdbc4.jar

5. Copy driver into river folder

   The reason is to include the JDBC driver into the Java classpath.

	    cp postgresql-9.1-902.jdbc4.jar $ES_HOME/plugins/river-jdbc/

6. Start Elasticsearch

   Just in the foreground to follow log messages on the console.

	    cd $ES_HOME
	    ./bin/elasticsearch

   Check if the river is installed correctly, Elasticsearch announces it in the second line logged. It must show ``loaded [jdbc-...]``.

	[2014-01-22 23:00:06,821][INFO ][node                     ] [Julie Power] version[...], pid[26152], build[c6155c5/2014-01-15T17:02:32Z]
	[2014-01-22 23:00:06,841][INFO ][node                     ] [Julie Power] initializing ...
	[2014-01-22 23:00:06,932][INFO ][plugins                  ] [Julie Power] loaded [jdbc-..., support-...], sites []

7. Create JDBC river

   This is just a basic example to a database `test` with user `fred` and password `secret`.
   The easiest method is using ``curl`` for a river creation via the REST interface.
   Use the port configured during PostgreSQL installation. The default is `5432`.
   ```
   curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/my_jdbc_river/_meta' -d '{
        "type" : "jdbc",
        "jdbc" : {
            "url" : "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test",
            "user" : "fred",
            "password" : "secret",
            "sql" : "select * from orders",
            "index" : "myindex",
            "type" : "mytype"
        }
   }'
   ```

8. Check log messages

   In case the user does not exist, Elasticsearch will log a message.

9. Repeat River creation until the river runs fine.


## Step by step recipe for using the JDBC river with MS SQL Server

1. Download Elasticsearch

2. Download SQL Server JDBC driver from [the vendor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/aa937724.aspx)

3. Put the `SQLJDBC4.jar` file in the lib folder of elasticsearch.

4. Download elasticsearch-river-jdbc using the plugin downloader. Navigate to the elasticsearch folder on your computer and run...
   ```
    ./bin/plugin --install jdbc --url ...
   ```

5. Set up the database you want to be indexed.
   [This includes allowing TCP/IP connections](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388042/connect-to-sql-server-2008-with-tcp-ip)

6. Start Elasticsearch
    ```
    ./elasticsearch.bat
    ```

7. Install a river like this
    ```
    curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/_river/scorecards_river/_meta' -d '
    {
        "type" : "jdbc",
        "jdbc": {
            "url":"jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=ICFV",
            "user":"elasticsearch",
            "password":"elasticsearch",
            "sql":"select * from ScoreCards",
            "index" : "myindex",
            "type" : "mytype"
        }
    }
    ```

8. You should see the river parsing the incoming data from the database in the logfile.

- install MySQL e.g. in /usr/local/mysql

- start MySQL on localhost:3306 (default)

- prepare a 'test' database in MySQL

- create empty user '' with empty password '' (this user should exist as default user, otherwise set up a password and adapt the example)

- execute SQL in "geo.dump" /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql test < src/test/resources/geo.dump

- then run this script: bash bin/river/mysql/geo.sh

    ```
    curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/_river/my_geo_river/'
    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_river/_refresh'
    curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/myjdbc'
    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_river/my_geo_river/_meta' -d '
